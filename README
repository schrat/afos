The below is a satiric game which is best played after a few
beers or at 300 baud (the effect is much the same).  It was
the very first c program I ever wrote so the code is ugly
(I'm still a fortran programmer) and can be cleaned up some,
no doubt.  I don't care, and I invite you to make whatever
adjustments you see fit.  Enough people locally have asked me
for the code I figured I'd post it.
